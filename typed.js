My stomach flips and I get butterflies. Every word you say sends goosebumps all over my body','Ive tried for so long not to look at you to not look at pictures of you to cut off all contact with you But I cant stop','I cant stop how I feel I dont know if Ill ever stop feeling this way. At least not for a long time','I see you with him it makes me sick to my stomach. And although that should put me off you, it doesnt It only makes me want you more','If you knew how I felt, I wouldnt even be writing this shitI wouldnt be so lonely. Youd understand how much you mean to me.','You mean so much to me','I wish youd look at me the way I look at you I wish I could be with you I just want to feel the warmth of your body next to mine. To see your smile I want to play with your hair. See it shine under the sun as it hits you just right','I want to watch the sun sink behind the heavens with you Talk, laugh, make out Anything I just want anything from you'],
